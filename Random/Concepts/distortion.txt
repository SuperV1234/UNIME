----------

Reflex-based timewaster game

Move with WSAD, aim with mouse.

Q flashes the player forward, and leaves a mark on your original position. 
You can use Q multiple times, leaving multiple marks (a queue of marks).

Pressing R flashes the player to the previous mark, deleting the mark.

After using Q, the player has a small invicibility window. Multiple Q usages
in rapid succession can allow the player to flash over large obstacles.

There is a limit on Q, to avoid spamming the ability.

Pressing E returns to the first mark, deleting all other marks.
